# scandigilib

> A library that generates thumbnails and metadata database for a digital library

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i scandigilib --save-dev
```

## Usage

### Scanning a whole directory.

This recursively scans the directory generating a thumbnail and metadata for
each file, storing the thumbnails and a database.json(for the metadata) file in the destination directory.  

```js
var scandigilib = require('scandigilib');

scandigilib.scanPDFdir([path-to-src-dir], [path-to-dest-dir]);

```

### Scanning a single file.

This generates a thumbnail which is stored at the destination directory and adds a single entry into the database.json file in the destination directory.


```js
var scandigilib = require('scandigilib');

scandigilib.scanPDF([path-to-src-file], [path-to-dest-dir]);

```
